## Background:
As of [v0.79, Mirror nodes](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/networks/release-notes/mirror-node#v0.79) now generate contract log events for non-EVM HAPI transactions. These "synthetic" events increase alignment between HTS and ERC standards and facilitate integrations with EVM tools, like The Graph.
Events are generated for HAPI transactions like: `CryptoTransfer, CryptoApproveAllowance, CryptoDeleteAllowance, TokenMint, TokenWipe, and TokenBurn`.
